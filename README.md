Hello! Welcome to my project!

This is still a work in process and probably will be for a long time.

I have always wanted to build some kind of organizer that connects to some APIs or a database. And I though that would be a GREAT project to get my hands dirty with REACT.JS so I decided to start the developement on this project and see where it goes.

This project uses React, React Bootstrap, and Firebase (JSON doc database not too different to MongoDB).

Feel free to look around and see how I put things together.
